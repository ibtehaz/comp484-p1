          Formula One (also known as <strong>Formula 1</strong> or
          <strong>F1</strong>) is the highest class of international racing for
          open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the
          Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The World Drivers'
          Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in
          1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world
          since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name
          refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must
          conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as
          Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits
          and closed public roads.
        </p>

        <p>
          A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World
          Championships: one for drivers, the other for constructors. Each
          driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing
          licence issued by the FIA. The races must run on tracks graded "1"
          (formerly "A"), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.
        </p>

        <p>
          Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in
          the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the
          generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. The cars
          underwent major changes in 2017, allowing wider front and rear wings,
          and wider tyres, resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g
          and top speeds of around 350 km/h (215 mph).As of 2021, the hybrid
          engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm; the
          cars are dependent on electronics and aerodynamics, suspension and
          tyres. Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus
          other electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994. They were
          briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since
          2004 and 2008 respectively.

          With the average annual cost of running a team - designing, building,
          and maintaining cars, pay, transport - being approximately US$247
          million, its financial and political battles are widely reported. On
          23 January 2017, Liberty Media completed the acquisition of the
          Formula One Group, from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for
          $8 billion.
