            <p>
                Three days of pre-season running ended with Lewis Hamilton on top on Day
                3, the seven-time champion having set the fastest lap as the clock
                ticked down. Before that, the Briton spoke about his excitement over
                shaking down the 2022 cars. Hamilton's first taste of the 2022 Mercedes
                W13 came at a Silverstone shakedown after their car launch, but he
                enjoyed a productive three days - completing 184 laps over three days
                before setting the ultimate benchmark on Friday. Much of that enthusiasm, reasoned Hamilton, was due to the new era of cars being built under a wide-ranging new set of technical rules changes - with fuel, tyres and of course aerodynamics being overhauled.

                “I think every year's exciting,” he continued, “but of course [in] previous years it was an evolution of the previous year's car, so in this one, it's completely brand new. Of course, I've seen the designs of our car over several months, but now to see everyone's car out there, you're trying to get a close eye to see what is different, if there is anything, why certain teams have chosen a certain route in terms of sidepod design, front wing and the floor.

                “So I think it's the most exciting [year], and again, you have absolutely no idea where you stand,” he added.
                
                The standings of course had Hamilton on top on Day 3, his team mate George Russell second on the timesheets - but there's still plenty of work to do before the field heads to Bahrain for the Official Pre-Season Test and opening Grand Prix on March 20.

            <p>
                Alfa Romeo have revealed images of the bold and striking red and white livery that will adorn their 2022 challenger - the C42.

The Swiss team ran a special camouflage design during three days of pre-season running in Barcelona, with Valtteri Bottas, rookie Zhou Guanyu and reserve Robert Kubica sharing driving duties.

A series of mechanical glitches confined the car to the garage for long periods, and they ultimately managed just 175 laps, putting them ninth out of 10 teams in the mileage charts. 

On Sunday, they became the final squad to launch their season - showcasing a livery that they said is “a subtle nod to the past, recalling historical designs of years past and the heritage of Alfa Romeo and Sauber Motorsport” in what will be the Hinwil team's 30th year in F1.

"The start of the season is always an exciting time, one in which we see the fruit of the work of hundreds of people over a long period of time,” said Team Principal Fred Vasseur.

“The C42 is a car we look forward to seeing racing, not just because it is the first we built in this new regulations cycle, one in which racing should be closer and more thrilling, but because we have the utmost confidence in this car helping the team make a big step forward towards the front of the grid.”- Posted on

            <h2 class="news-title">Perez encouraged by Red Bull's 'good baseline' after Barcelona running</h2>
            <p>
                Sergio Perez left Barcelona feeling optimistic after Red Bull's pre-season showing in Spain - saying that the team built a solid foundation on which to continue when the Official Pre-Season Test begins in Bahrain.

Perez completed 152 laps - 11th in the mileage stakes - over the three days, and posted the third-fastest time on Day 3 behind the two Mercedes. He also tested Pirelli's 18-inch intermediate compounds early on Friday afternoon.

“The C42 is a car we look forward to seeing racing, not just because it is the first we built in this new regulations cycle, one in which racing should be closer and more thrilling, but because we have the utmost confidence in this car helping the team make a big step forward towards the front of the grid.” Reflecting on the three-day session, he said: “Yes, I think we got a good baseline. I definitely think we have a good potential. It's obviously very early days. I really hope that we are able to make a good step come Bahrain, and yes, [I hope we will] just keep progressing from all the information that we gathered from here.” With Red Bull defending the drivers' title and aiming to secure their first constructors' championship since 2013, Perez was asked what the team needed to do in order to push towards their ultimate goal.

“I think it's a progression throughout the year; it's important just to keep making steps, keep making progress, and keep learning from my driving, the way I'm adapting the car and the team - what's the best way to maximise it?” he replied.

“Because, I think it's going to be quite a different challenge from qualifying… to race day. You have seen these cars [porpoising] so I think it's going to be a challenge to maximise the whole weekend.” - Posted on
